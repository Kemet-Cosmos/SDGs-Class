          üåç Imagine waking up one day in a tent in a forest‚Ä¶ and suddenly
          finding out that your compass is lost! How will you find your way back
          home? Or even‚Ä¶ how will you take a single step at all?!

        <motion.div {...ViewPort} {...FadeLeft}>
          That‚Äôs what could happen to our planet if the SDGs disappear. Without
          a compass, we lose our path to survival.

        <motion.div {...ViewPort} {...FadeLeft}>
          At first, no one noticed the difference. The cities were still
          crowded, the factories still running, and the seas still swayed in
          calm. But something
          <Link href="/lesson">began to change‚Ä¶</Link>

        <motion.div {...ViewPort} {...FadeLeft}>
          The air grew heavier. <br />
          The rains fell harder. <br />
          And the seas swallowed the shores, step by step.

          In the absence of a plan, each nation turned to itself. The poor were
          left behind the walls, schools shut their doors, and forests turned
          into deserts. <br />
          Even the songs of birds became just a memory.
